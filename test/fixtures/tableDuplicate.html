  <p>
    The tool identified these properties as duplicate entries.  Duplicate entries are still counted in the other three categories of results.  An address appears in the duplicate count because there is more than one identical address in your CSV file.  These duplicates should not be included in your more than 50 percent test calculation of rural or underserved properties.

    To update or remove the information for these addresses, start a new search.
