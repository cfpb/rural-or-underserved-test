  <p>First-lien covered transactions extended in <span class="chosenYear">2015</span> that are secured by these properties can be counted as rural or underserved in your determination of whether more than 50 percent of your first-lien covered transactions in <span class="chosenYear">2015</span> are secured by properties located in rural or underserved areas.  If your institution meets this more than 50 percent test based on your <span class="chosenYear">2015</span> loans, you meet the requirement of operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas for purposes of <span class="chosenYear1">2016</span> and for loan applications received before April 1, <span class="chosenYear2">2017</span>.  </p>
