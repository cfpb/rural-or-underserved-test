          <h2>About this tool</h2>
          <p>
            This tool is maintained by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB or Bureau) to help creditors determine which properties are located in a &ldquo;rural&rdquo; or &ldquo;underserved&rdquo; area as defined in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B).  A creditor may rely on this tool to provide a safe harbor determination that a property is located in a rural or underserved area.  However, the tool is not applicable to the exemption from the § 1026.35(c)(4) requirement for an additional appraisal, which is based on &ldquo;rural county&rdquo; and not &ldquo;rural area.&rdquo;  The CFPB publishes a list of counties that are entirely rural to facilitate compliance with the exemption in § 1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H).
          </p>

          <p>
            If more than 50 percent of a small creditor’s total first-lien covered transactions in the preceding year or, for certain transactions, the year prior to the preceding year, are secured by properties that are located in areas that are either rural or underserved, a small creditor may be eligible for special provisions and exemptions under certain CFPB regulatory requirements.

            <div class="answer hide">
              <p>
                The tool identifies whether a property is located in a rural or underserved area in a particular calendar year.  Creditors can select a year and enter addresses into the tool, either one at a time or more than one at a time (a &ldquo;batch upload&rdquo;), and the tool provides a determination of whether each address is in a rural or underserved area for the year selected.

            <h4 class="col-10">How does the output from the tool help to prove to my regulator that I operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas?</h4>
            <div class="answer hide">
              <p>
                The tool identifies whether a specific property securing a mortgage loan is located in a rural or underserved area, either a rural or underserved county or a rural census block.  The tool does not provide certification that a creditor is operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas – that is, whether more than 50 percent of the creditor’s total first lien covered transactions were secured by properties located in rural or underserved areas during the preceding calendar year or, for some transactions, the year prior to the preceding calendar year.  The creditor will have to make that determination from the information it gathers using the lists of rural or underserved counties, this tool, the automated tool provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, or through another method – on whether more than 50 percent of its loans are secured by properties located in rural or underserved areas in a given year.  You should keep a copy of your results that show the determination for each address run through the tool.

            <h4 class="col-10">How should I format the addresses that I upload to the tool?</h4>
            <div class="answer hide">
              <p>
                The tool provides a sample comma separated values (CSV) file to help you determine how to format the addresses for upload in the multiple address search tool.  For best results, the street address, city, state and ZIP Code should be included in the batch upload file or address entry.  The addresses within this CSV file should follow the rules set forth in Section 2, &ldquo;Postal Addressing Standards&rdquo; of the United States Postal Service Publication 28 - Postal Addressing Standards (<a href="http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm" title="Publication 28,">http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/welcome.htm</a>).  Per <a href="http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28c2_001.htm" title="Publication 28, Sub-Section 21">Publication 28, Sub-Section 21</a>, a complete property address consists of the &ldquo;Delivery Address Line&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Last Line.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Delivery Address Line,&rdquo; in the example below and in the tool CSV file format, consists of the &ldquo;Street address&rdquo; while the &ldquo;Last Line,&rdquo; in the example below and in the tool CSV file format, consists of three fields, &ldquo;City&rdquo;, &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;ZIP&rdquo;.

            <div class="answer hide">
              <p>
                To upload addresses, you will first need to extract the requested data fields (street address, city, state and ZIP Code) from your loan origination system or database into the Comma Separated Values (CSV) format that the multiple address upload feature requires.  Once the CSV file is created, you click on the &ldquo;upload a file&rdquo; feature that the tool provides, select the file from your hard drive or internal drive and then click the &ldquo;upload a file&rdquo; button again to start the process.

                The results will be displayed on a web page after the processing completes in four categories: Rural/Underserved, Not Rural/Underserved, Could Not Be Identified, and Duplicates.  The addresses that return in the Rural/Underserved category will qualify as being in rural or underserved areas.  Those in the Not Rural/Underserved category are addresses that are not in areas designated as rural or underserved.  Addresses in the Could Not Be Identified category will need to be researched further to determine if they are in rural or underserved areas (see &ldquo;How do I resolve the addresses that could not be identified?&rdquo; below).  For the Duplicates category, the properties are still counted in one of the three aforementioned categories.  The user must determine which entries are duplicates.  An institution should not count a property more than once when determining if it operates predominantly in rural or underserved areas unless more than one first-lien covered transaction was secured by the property in the same year.

                You should only enter addresses for properties securing first-lien covered transactions extended in a single calendar year.  When you are determining rural or underserved status for the current year, you enter addresses for properties securing first-lien covered transactions extended in the preceding calendar year.  For transactions with applications received before April 1 of the current year, you could also enter addresses for properties securing first-lien covered transactions extended in the calendar year before the preceding calendar year.

                &ldquo;Address Entered&rdquo; will appear in the results as the address that you entered to search. &ldquo;Address Identified&rdquo; will appear in the results as the address for which the rural or underserved determination applies.  These two fields will more than likely match; however, on occasion, there may be differences in the address entered versus the address for which the designation was found.  These differences are displayed when these two fields do not match, for example, if the address entered is 123 S. Main St, Anywhereville, USA and the address for which the rural designation was identified was 123 S. Main Blvd, Anywhereville, USA.  It would then be up to you to determine if the match is accurate for the address entered, e.g., was there a typographical error in the system of record when the address was keyed in or are the two addresses actually different locations?

                On occasion, there may be differences in the address entered versus the address for which a designation was found.  These differences are displayed when the &ldquo;Address Entered&rdquo; field and the &ldquo;Address Identified&rdquo; field do not match.  It is up to you to determine if this match is accurate for the address entered, e.g., was there a typographical error in the system of record when the address was keyed in, or are the two addresses actually different locations?  The issue also might have occurred because one of the required fields was missing on the search.  For best results, the street address, city, state and ZIP Code should be included in the batch upload file or address entry.  If the address is correct as-is and the tool is not finding the address, please check the Census Bureau’s automated address search tool, use the rural or underserved counties lists, or check the form of the address on the United States Postal Service site (<a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input" title="United States Postal Service site">https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input</a>).  For instance, the address 6009 JFK Blvd East, West New York, NJ 07093 cannot be located by the tool.  When the address is entered into the usps.com site, the proper address is given, 6009 Kennedy Blvd E, West New York, NJ 07093-3740, and the address can now be identified in the tool.

            <h4 class="col-10">How do I resolve the addresses that could not be identified?</h4>
            <div class="answer hide">
              <p>
                Before researching the addresses that could not be identified, you should determine whether you can confirm without these addresses that you are operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas – that is, whether more than 50 percent of your total first lien covered transactions were secured by properties located in rural or underserved areas during the preceding calendar year.  Conversely, before researching the addresses that could not be identified, you should consider whether your institution will have more than 50 percent first lien covered transactions secured by properties located in rural or underserved areas if these unidentified addresses are determined to be rural or underserved.  If you find that your institution needs to know if these addresses determine whether your institution operated in predominantly rural or underserved areas, you should then check to see if the address was mistyped, some information was missing in the address entered, or the address is too new for the tool to return a definite result.  First, verify the address is correct.  If it is correct, try the Census Bureau’s automated address search tool, use the rural or underserved counties lists, or check the form of the address on the United States Postal Service site (<a href="https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input" title="United States Postal Service site">https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input</a>).  For instance, the address 6009 JFK Blvd East, West New York, NJ 07093 cannot be located by the tool.

              <p>
                It is possible that some addresses are too new to appear in the tool, and addresses that could not be identified should be attempted again 60, 90 or 120 days later.  You also have the option to demonstrate that a property is &ldquo;rural&rdquo; or &ldquo;underserved,&rdquo; as defined in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B), by other means not covered by the safe harbors.  If an update or change to an address is required, make the change in your systems of record first, then retry the upload.  For best results, include the street address, city, state and ZIP Code in the batch upload file or your address entry.

                No. The rural or underserved designation is identified by the categorization of the address and not based on the location of the address on the visual map that accompanies the search result.  The map exists as a visual aid only to show the geographic location of the property.

              <p>
                The tool designated the address entered as not rural or underserved as those terms are defined in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B), respectively.  If the address is not designated in the tool as rural or underserved, lenders have the option to check the address on the Census Bureau’s automated address search tool or use the rural or underserved counties lists. Lenders also have the option to demonstrate the property is rural or underserved, as those terms are defined, by other means not covered by the safe harbors.

            <div class="answer hide">
              <p>
                The calculation is based on the first-lien covered transactions that your institution extended in a given year.  Addresses for properties securing these first-lien covered transactions should be run through this tool, the Census Bureau’s automated address search tool, checked with the rural or underserved counties lists, or researched another way to determine the creditor’s status as operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas.  Based on the results, a determination must be made as to the percentage of first-lien covered transactions secured by properties located in rural or underserved areas.  If more than 50 percent of the first-lien covered transactions your organization extended during the preceding calendar year are secured by properties located in rural or underserved areas, the lender would meet the rural or underserved test and qualify as a lender operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas for the current year.  A lender may also qualify as a lender operating predominantly in rural or underserved areas for transactions with applications received by the lender before April 1 of the current calendar year, if it meets the rural or underserved test in the year prior to the preceding year.
